- throw out pythonutil.hxx?

- remove meshIter

- replace Rect2D with Box<int, 2> (in C++ and Python)
  (maybe wait for Box to appear in VIGRA repo? but API won't change)

- remove pythondiff2d.cxx eventually?

- fix the Makefiles/build system (use CMake?)

- channelrepresentation.cxx was excluded from build
